# Pushing Version 6 to GitHub

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `schoolyearcalendarv6`
3. Choose Public or Private
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Once the repository is created, run this command:

```bash
git push -u v6 main
```

This will push all your v6 changes to the new repository.

## Current Setup

- **v5 repository**: `origin` → `https://github.com/Shmar10/schooldaysv5.git` (unchanged)
- **v6 repository**: `v6` → `https://github.com/Shmar10/schoolyearcalendarv6.git` (ready to push)

## What's Been Committed

The following v6 changes have been committed locally:
- Multi-school configuration system
- Config loader module
- Updated data.js to use configs
- School configuration files
- Documentation

Your v5 repository remains untouched on GitHub.
